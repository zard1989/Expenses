Expenses

Expenses is a simple expense management program written in Perl. It has a command-line user interface. You can easily log your expenses, make budgets and simply analyze them through commands that are easy to memorize.

To create a new expense, just type:

    new

Then there are few questions following.

Each expense has four columns. They are date, category, description and amount. You can then query some expenses by these columns.

To find out some expenses with conditions, here are some examples for you:

    1. show date 2009.9.3 #Show all the expenses in 2009.9.3
    2. show date 2009.9 #Show all the expenses in September, 2009
    3. show date 2009.9 category 飲料 #Show all the beverage in September, 2009
    4. show >= 1000 # Show all the expenses which amount are higher than 100 dollars

The "daily" command shows the daily expenses. It shows today's expenses, but you can give it a date.

You can type "help" or "help command" whenever you need some help.
